      song1Lyrics:
        "VERSE 1 - Lately there's been a lot of lovey-dovey - Round four with the wifey like bunnies - Bathe her in the water of the word - The water with the honey - She stays naked in the house - So pleasing to be in her presence - The king is back on the throne - She does it to make a home for him | CHORUS - Home sweet home - Da Bubu for breakfast - Nose rash so i had to switch it up - News flash - when did you become a judge ? | VERSE 2 - Bright & early - birds chirping - Singing to me to get the word in - On the balcony - a cup of coffee - Call Eddie - talk about the new beat - If I like the beat then ima use it - Give it all away so you can't sue me - I worked the past 10 years for free - Not hiding - you know where to find me | CHORUS - Home sweet home - Da Bubu for breakfast - Nose rash so i had to switch it up - News flash - when did you become a judge ? | OUTRO - Are you lord Da Bubu ? Da Bubu - Home sweet home X2",

      song2Lyrics:
        "VERSE - We are back from the dead like Lazarus - For better or worse a road awaits us - Drive through with the legs like drills - We wear only black like johnny cash to symbolize the downtrodden - Pros at rejection and self-hatred - Is it real or is it fake ? - it sure seems real - Convinced that its real now - that wasn't the deal - We escape by pouring out our inner beings | BRIDGE - On the canvas - On the song - On the paper - On the skin | CHORUS - Pour it out now from the core of your being X8 | OUTRO - Pour it out now - Pour it out now from the core of your being X4",

        "VERSE 1 - An alternative bean - A long way from Jersey - The memories do not bother me like they did before - Over 50 is ripe - Fresh off the tree - take a bite - It's just what I like - It's just what I needed | CHORUS 1 - Two sides to (every coin) - Six sides to (every dice) - Many moons - many moods to you - Who are you ? | VERSE 2 - It gets better in time - Ages like fine wine - Wisdom & experience - My soul is attracted - Let it be a reminder - You don't need the make-up to hide it - Your value increases each day that passes like Avril Lavigne | CHORUS 2 - Two sides to (every coin) - Six sides to (every dice) - Many colors to the auras that she has - Who are you ? | VERSE 3 - There's many fish in the sea but some are a rare breed - Might never see them again so cherish every moment while you can | CHORUS 3 - Two sides to (every coin) - Six sides to (every dice) - | OUTRO - There's many fish in the sea but some are a rare breed - Might never see them again so cherish every moment while you can",

      song6Lyrics:
        "VERSE - A parable unspoken - Let your reputation go to ruin - Talk with God for once now, will you ? - A dog will always bite the bones you throw to em' - Random places of the US - On & off lit this whole time - Ten years & you still won't take me home - Not even just to catch my breath - A beast from the north east - New Jersey - From right over the bridge - Why's your eyes so big & your neck always broken ? - Never fought me fair - Im'a Nu-Breed - an experiment - At this point nobody can relate - I'm alone in this place but that's ok - It's just the way it is",
